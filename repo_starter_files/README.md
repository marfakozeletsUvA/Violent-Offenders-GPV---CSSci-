# Violence Against Journalists: Network Prediction Project

> GPV: Unequal Machines Grand Challenge

## Research Question

Does Global North military intervention destabilize countries in ways that increase violence against journalists—and does the international community then treat that violence as "expected", leading to systematic impunity?

## Project Overview

This project uses **network analysis** combined with **machine learning** to predict impunity outcomes for violence against journalists. We construct networks capturing military intervention ties, colonial history, and conflict spillover to examine how a country's position in global power structures affects whether perpetrators face justice.

### Two Phases
1. **Mindless Machine** — Build a predictive algorithm optimizing for performance
2. **Auditor Phase** — Critical bias audit using postcolonial theory
