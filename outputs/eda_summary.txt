EDA SUMMARY
============================================================

TARGET VARIABLE (CPJ Journalist Killings):
- 763 country-years, 2,550 total killings
- Highly right-skewed (mean=3.3, median=2)
- Top countries: Iraq, Palestine, Mexico, Philippines, Syria
- Modeling approach: Negative binomial regression (count data)

TEMPORAL COVERAGE:
- All datasets overlap: 1992-2013 (recommended analysis window)
- AidData ends 2013 (binding constraint)
- UCDP ends 2017, SIPRI/Debt/ODA extend to 2023-2024

PREDICTOR DISTRIBUTIONS:
- Arms, Aid, Debt: Log-normal → use log transforms
- UCDP: Training most common, troops rare
- Colonial: Britain (65), France (40), Spain (30) dominate

MERGE COVERAGE (1992-2013):
- AidData: 97%
- ODA: 91%  
- Debt: 80%
- SIPRI: 74%
- Full overlap: 60% (296 country-years)

NOTES FOR MODELING:
- UCDP low overlap (34%) is expected — only conflict countries
- Missing SIPRI = no arms imports (can treat as zero)
- Consider two models: full data (1992-2013) vs extended (1992-2024 without AidData)
